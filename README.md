# Project Name: Customer Behavior EDA

## 1. Aim
To perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on customer behavior data, aimed at uncovering patterns, trends, and key factors that influence customer decisions.

## 2. Objectives
- **Objective 1:** Analyze purchasing patterns across different time frames to identify trends.
- **Objective 2:** Explore customer behavior across various product categories to highlight significant patterns.
- **Objective 3:** Visualize the data to extract actionable insights and support business strategy formulation.
- **Objective 4:** Identify correlations between different features and their impact on customer purchase decisions.

## 4. Dataset Details
- **Dataset Name:** `dataset.csv`
- **Source:** [Online Retail Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/databricks/Spark-The-Definitive-Guide/master/data/retail-data/all/online-retail-dataset.csv)
- **Description:** The dataset includes customer behavior data such as purchase history, browsing patterns, and demographic details. It contains multiple features that allow for in-depth analysis of customer preferences and purchasing decisions.
- **Number of Records:** 541,909 rows
- **Number of Features:** 8 Features

## 6. Methodology
- **Data Cleaning:**  
  Steps taken to clean and preprocess the data, including handling missing values and outliers.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  Techniques used to explore the data, including visualizations, statistical summaries, and pattern recognition.
- **Feature Engineering:**  
  Any new features created to enhance the dataset's predictive power.

## 7. Tools and Libraries Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 8. Results
- **Purchasing Patterns:** Identified trends in purchasing behavior across different time frames, showing peak purchasing periods.
- **Product Categories:** Certain product categories showed higher purchase rates, indicating customer preferences.
- **Customer Behavior:** Recognized patterns in customer behavior, such as frequent purchases by certain demographics.
- **Correlations:** Found correlations between features like age, income, and purchasing decisions, highlighting key factors influencing customer behavior.

## 9. Conclusion
This EDA provided valuable insights into customer behavior, revealing significant patterns and correlations that can inform business strategies. The analysis showed how different factors like product categories and time frames impact customer decisions. These findings can be used to tailor marketing efforts and improve customer engagement strategies.
